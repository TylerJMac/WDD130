    <h1>About me: Tyler McNamara</h1>
    <p>Hey there everyone, let me introduce myself. I'm Tyler McNamara, and I am currently attending BYUI.
        My major is in Biology, with a focus on marine biology. Some of my hobbies/interest's include games,
        tennis, pottery and reading. I am single and I am probably one of the youngest attendee's of this course.
        Im currently working part-time at a grocery store in Idaho. One of aspect of BYUI that I enjoy is the 
        ability to take online classes in order to pursue my eductation, but on my own time.I am taking this class
        in order to learn more about career's that I might be interested in. I believe this information is going  
        to be a big help the more the internet continue's to grow.   </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church since I was born and one of my favorite scriptures is in D&C 6:36. It reads
        "Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not". This is my paragraph
    </p>
